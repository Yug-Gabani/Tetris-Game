<br>This project is a console-based Tetris game implemented in C++. It features Tetrominoes, movement controls, rotation, scoring, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses.

<h2>⭕️Features</h2>
<br>↳Supports different Tetromino shapes following the original Tetris rules.
<br>↳Allows movement (left, right, down) and rotation of pieces.
<br>↳Detects collisions and line completions.
<br>↳Increases difficulty as the game progresses.
<br>↳Displays the current score and game-over conditions.

<h2>⭕️Tetromino Shapes</h2>
<br>Below are the standard Tetromino shapes used in the game:

<br>↳I-Shape: Four blocks in a straight line.
<br>↳O-Shape: Square shape.
<br>↳T-Shape: Three blocks in a row with one in the center.
<br>↳S-Shape: Zig-zag pattern.
<br>↳Z-Shape: Reverse of S-Shape.
<br>↳J-Shape: Three blocks in a row with one extending down.
<br>↳L-Shape: Three blocks in a row with one extending up.

<h2>⭕️Controls</h2>
<br>↳Left Arrow (←): Move left
<br>↳Right Arrow (→): Move right
<br>↳Down Arrow (↓): Move down faster
<br>↳Up Arrow (↑): Rotate the piece
<br>↳Spacebar: Instantly drop the piece
<br>↳Enter: Restart the game after Game Over
<br>↳Escape: Exit the game

<h2>⭕️How to Play</h2>
<br>↳A random Tetromino falls from the top of the board.
<br>↳Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the piece.
<br>↳Completing a full row clears it and increases your score.
<br>↳The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the board.
<br>↳The objective is to achieve the highest score possible.

<h2>⭕️Requirements</h2>

<br>Windows OS (due to the use of windows.h and conio.h)
<br>A C++ compiler supporting Windows API functions

<h2>⭕️Compilation and Execution</h2>
<br>Compile the game using g++:<br>
g++ tetris.cpp -o tetris.exe<br>

Run the game:<br>
tetris.exe<br>

<h2>⭕️Notes</h2>
<br>↳The game runs in a console window and uses Unicode characters for better visuals.
<br>↳The drop speed increases as the player clears more lines.

<br>Enjoy playing Tetris!
